### Not my original idea

I've maden this while i was watching [Selman Kahya's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Z-Gc_BkYuW75jKcTJICJA) Youtube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsiArTIqetE&t=14195s), game/app is not my original idea, the original name is "Klavye Delikanlisi". It belongs to him. But i want to add a leaderboard later.

### Built with
